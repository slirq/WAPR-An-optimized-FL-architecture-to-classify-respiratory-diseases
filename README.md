## Abstract

Respiratory Diseases are a significant global health concern, and their accurate diagnosis is crucial. Traditional diagnosis through auscultation has limitations, leading to the introduction of an AI-based solution in this work. The solution employs Deep Learning for disease classification and a custom Federated Learning (FL) approach to enhance model accuracy while preserving data privacy. The FL architecture, named FedWAPR, utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and a novel aggregation algorithm, achieving a test accuracy of 92% for various respiratory diseases and heart failure.
